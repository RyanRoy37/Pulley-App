         A Poly V pulley, also known as a serpentine pulley or multi-groove pulley, is 
         designed to work in conjunction with a Poly V belt (also called a serpentine belt or ribbed belt).
         Poly V belts have multiple V-shaped ribs on the inside surface, and Poly V pulleys are grooved to 
         match these ribs. The design allows for efficient power transmission and improved grip compared to 
         traditional V-belts.

         Types of Poly V Pulleys in a Cable Belt Conveyor System:
         </div>
         <div class="row1">
         Drive Pulley:
         The drive pulley is typically located at the head or drive end of the conveyor.
        It is connected to the motor or power source to provide the driving force for the conveyor belt.
         </div>
         <div class="row1">
         Tail Pulley:
         The tail pulley is located at the opposite end of the conveyor from the drive pulley.
         It provides a point for the return of the conveyor belt.
         </div>
       <div class="row1">
        Bend Pulley:
        Bend pulleys are used to change the direction of the belt as it travels around the conveyor system.
         They are often placed between two sections of the conveyor to guide the belt around a bend.
</div>
<div class="row1">
Snub Pulley:
Snub pulleys are designed to increase the wrap angle of the belt around the drive pulley.
This increases traction and reduces the likelihood of belt slipping.
</div>
<div class="row1">
Take-Up Pulley:
Take-up pulleys are used to maintain proper tension in the conveyor belt.
They can be adjustable to compensate for belt stretching over time.
</div>
<div class="row1">
Idler Pulley:
Idler pulleys are non-powered pulleys that support and guide the conveyor belt.
They are often placed along the length of the conveyor to reduce sag and improve belt stability.
